    "# Lab: Schelling Model and its variants\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schelling Model of Segregation, introduced by Thomas Schelling in the 1970s, is a foundational agent-based model used to study how local preferences can lead to large-scale spatial segregation, even when individuals only have mild biases. In the model, agents of different types (e.g., colors or groups) occupy a grid and move if their local neighborhood does not meet a certain satisfaction threshold—typically based on the proportion of similar neighbors. Despite its simplicity, the Schelling model reveals powerful insights about emergent collective behavior and is widely used in fields such as economics, sociology, and urban studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement and explore several key variants of the Schelling model to understand how changes in assumptions or rules can alter the system’s dynamics and outcomes. "

    "## Before We Start: Building a Flexible Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "To systematically explore the Schelling model and its variants, we start by **decomposing the model into modular components**. This helps us better understand how individual choices and system rules affect emergent patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We identify the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization strategies**: how the city and agents are initially distributed  \n",
    "  – *e.g.*, random placement, balanced layout, half-full blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent selection**: which agent moves next  \n",
    "  – *e.g.*, random agent, agent with lowest utility\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target selection**: where the agent may want to move  \n",
    "  – *e.g.*, random vacant cell, block with highest utility\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Move acceptance rule**: when a move is allowed  \n",
    "  – *e.g.*, only if personal utility increases, or social welfare increases, or via Metropolis-Hastings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stopping criteria**: when to halt the simulation  \n",
    "  – *e.g.*, fixed number of steps, or no more accepted moves"

    "- `agent_selector.py`: strategy for choosing which agent moves\n",
    "- `target_selector.py`: strategy for choosing where the agent might move\n",
    "- `move_acceptor.py`: rule for deciding whether a move is accepted\n",
    "- `stop_criterion.py`: determines when to stop the simulation\n",
    "- `utils.py`: shared utility functions and plotting tools\n",

    "Each module provides a **baseline implementation** that is simple but functional. You can find them in the respective `.py` files.\n",
